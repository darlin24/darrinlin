    <h1>Board of Directors</h1>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 1%;">Our school's board of directors. The title of the page and its surrounding graphics resembles the cover of the yearbook, adding to the common theme. A fade effect is applied between the title square-like graphic and the group picture, so that the graphic would not be a complete carryover and the group picture would appear more natural and fitting with the background color. To label their positions and names creatively, we decided that along the bottom horizontally should be the position, and along the left vertically should be their names, with first name in decorative font and last name in serif.</p>

    <h1>High School Principal</h1>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 1%">Ms. Clark's page. Alike to the superintendent page, the title (including the name and position) are outlined in their opposite color (i.e. black) for contrast with the background. After experimenting, I found that sticking to the white color scheme caused by the high amounts of light in the picture to be the cleanest solution. Thus, the letter text is in black while the letter background rectangle is in white. Ms. Clark here is placed on the right so we included the text on the left for balance. While there is high ambient backlight, her face is not darkened because there is enough horizontal light from the sun, creating a light, cinematic, but not overly dramatic picture.</p>
